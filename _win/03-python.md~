We recommend using Python version 2.7 for the exercises in the CodeRefinery
workshop, but if you have a strong preference for version 3.5 that will work as
well.

Watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

- Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads) with your web browser.
- Download the Python 2 installer for Windows.
- Install Python 2 using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check
  `Make Anaconda the default Python`.


### How to verify the installation

In the command prompt, type:

```shell
$ python --version
```
If your installation was successful, this should return something like

```shell
Python 2.7.12 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.
```

To check if you can successfully import a specific package, you can type

```shell
$ python -c "import <package-name>"
```

and verify that you do not get an ImportError.

The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook
icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu.
Verify that it opens up a new tab in your browser showing the Jupyter dashboard.
