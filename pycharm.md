"Community" version of the software.


## How to verify the installation

After the installation is complete, please make sure you can run the application.
If you want to learn more right away, please check
[PyCharm features](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/).


## Note about the professional edition

If you are curious about the professional edition, you can download a 30-days
trial and opt-out from it later. One component of the course (profiling in the
IDE) will demonstrate a feature of the professional edition. However, it is not
necessary that you install the professional edition to follow the course.
