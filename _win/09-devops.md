Note: installation of this software is not compulsory! Installation of this software may require special access rights you don't nece
ssarily have. Especially VirtualBox will change system settings, before installing it verify that you are allowed to do so, if you are not using your own computer.

Vagrant is one of the DevOps tools that are introduced in this course. With it you can automate installation of virtual machines on your personal computer. You will also need VirtualBox installed as a requirement.

For VirtualBox, you can find binaries for different platforms from: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

For Vagrant, you can find installation packages from: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
