# Terminal editors

Usually, when we want to create a text document, what we do is to use a program like Word. When the icon for Word is clicked, a graphical user interface (GUI) opens with an area to type what you want and menus and icons to perform operations like copy-paste and save. 

When we work on the terminal we do not have a GUI. But there are programs called “terminal text editors”, that we can use to type text. We can do the same open, type, cut,  copy, paste, save operations on these editors as well. However, we have to use keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse. The keyboard shortcuts involves pressing and holding the Ctrl key or the Alt and pressing another key at the same time. Below you will find details about two such editors.

## Nano:
Easiest to use but with minimal functionality. This comes installed as default on most Ubuntu distributions and we recommend this to be used with Git, if you do not already have a favorite editor.

Mac: 
Git for Windows:

### How to use it:

Ctrl + x (hold the Ctlr key and press the x)
#### To move up, down, left or right with the document
