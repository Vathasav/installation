Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you
compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two-
and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for
many popular version control systems.

Install meld via your distribution package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install meld
```

For Fedora:

```shell
$ sudo yum install meld
```


### How to verify the installation

To test it create two files which are similar and then compare them
with Meld or Diffuse:

```shell
$ meld file1 file2
```
