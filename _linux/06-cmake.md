CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test
and package software.

Install CMake using your default distribution package manager.
For Debian/Ubuntu run:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```

For Fedora:

```shell
$ sudo yum install cmake
```


### How to verify the installation

This command should give you the version of the CMake tool and not throw errors:

```shell
$ cmake --version
```
