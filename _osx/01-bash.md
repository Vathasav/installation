title: Bash
---

The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no need to install
anything. You access Bash from the Terminal (found in
`/Applications/Utilities`.

See the Git installation [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY)
(copyright Software Carpentry) for an example on how to open the Terminal.

You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
