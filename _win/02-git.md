Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what
when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your
code on [GitHub](https://github.com). You will need a supported web browser
(current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or
above).

Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash install (described above).

You will need an account at [GitHub](https://github.com) for parts of the Git
lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub
account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal
information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review
[these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.
