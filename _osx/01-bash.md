title: Bash
---

The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no need to install
anything. You access Bash from the terminal (found in
`/Applications/Utilities`).

Watch the Git installation [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY)
(copyright Software Carpentry) for an example on how to open the terminal.

You may want to keep the terminal in your dock for this workshop.
