Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you
compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two-
and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for
many popular version control systems.

On Mac OS X, there are other visual comparison tools. Please browse the net and
install your favourite one. Make sure they cooperate with Git since this often
makes comparison and conflict resolution easier.

To install Meld, please follow installation instructions from
[http://meldmerge.org](http://meldmerge.org).
