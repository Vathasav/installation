Once you have installed Git Bash you can install Make by:

- Download make.exe from [here](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/blob/master/bin/make.exe?raw=true).
- Place it in the bin directory where you installed Git Bash e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin`.


### How to verify the installation

This command should give you the version of the Make tool and not throw errors:

```shell
$ make --version
```
