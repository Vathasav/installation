Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what
when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your
code on [GitHub](https://github.com). You will need a supported web browser
(current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or
above).

You will need an account at [GitHub](https://github.com) for parts of the Git
lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub
account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal
information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review
[these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via
your distribution package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

For Fedora:

```shell
$ sudo yum install git
```


### How to verify the installation

Typing:

```shell
$ git --version
```

Should give you a version (like here) and not an error (do not worry if the
version is different on your system):

```shell
git version 2.10.2
```
