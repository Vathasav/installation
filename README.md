## How to add instructions

Get inspired by https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/ but add attribution.

Add Markdown files to the directories:

```
_linux
_osx
_windows
```

The files in these directories are rendered in the alphabetical order.


## Styling

Feel free to improve styling but insist that instructions are written in Markdown
and the content (Markdown) is kept separate from the templating and styling.
