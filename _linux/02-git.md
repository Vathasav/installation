If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via
your distribution package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

For Fedora:

```shell
$ sudo yum install git
```

Also describe how to get a GitHub account.


### How to verify the installation

Typing:

```shell
$ git --version
```

Should give you a version (like here) and not an error (do not worry if the
version is different on your system):

```shell
git version 2.10.2
```
