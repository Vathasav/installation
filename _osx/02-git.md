### OS X 10.9 and higher

Install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks"
installer from
[this list](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).

After installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications`
folder, as Git is a command line program.


### Older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)

Use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" available
[here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).


### How to verify the installation

Typing:

```shell
$ git --version
```

Should give you a version (like here) and not an error (do not worry if the
version is different on your system):

```shell
git version 2.10.2
```
