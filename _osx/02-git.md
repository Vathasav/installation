Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what
when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your
code on [GitHub](https://github.com). You will need a supported web browser
(current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or
above).

You will need an account at [GitHub](https://github.com) for parts of the Git
lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub
account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal
information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review
[these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.


### OS X 10.9 and higher

Install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks"
installer from
[this list](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).

After installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications`
folder, as Git is a command line program.


### Older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)

Use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" available
[here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).


### How to verify the installation

Typing:

```shell
$ git --version
```

Should give you a version (like here) and not an error (do not worry if the
version is different on your system):

```shell
git version 2.10.2
```
